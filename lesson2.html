				<p>One day, a fox became very hungry as he went to search for some food. He searched high and low, but
					couldn’t find something that he could eat.

					Finally, as his stomach rumbled, he stumbled upon a farmer’s wall. At the top of the wall, he saw
					the biggest, juiciest grapes he’d ever seen. They had a rich, purple color, telling the fox they
					were ready to be eaten.

					To reach the grapes, the fox had to jump high in the air. As he jumped, he opened his mouth to catch
					the grapes, but he missed. The fox tried again but missed yet again.

					He tried a few more times but kept failing..</p>

			<p>Finally, the fox decided it was time to give up and go home. While he walked away, he muttered, “I’m sure
				the grapes were sour anyway.”
